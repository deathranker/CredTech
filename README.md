# CredTech – Explainable Credit Intelligence Platform

## 📌 Overview
CredTech is a *Real-Time Explainable Credit Intelligence Platform* built for the *CredTech Hackathon, organized by *The Programming Club, IIT Kanpur and powered by Deep Root Investments.  

The project addresses the limitations of traditional credit rating systems, which are:
- Updated infrequently  
- Based on opaque methodologies  
- Often lagging behind real-world events  

Our solution leverages *Python, AI/ML, and data pipelines* to generate *real-time, transparent, and explainable creditworthiness scores* using both *structured* and *unstructured financial data*.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement
To build a platform that:
1. *Ingests and processes* structured & unstructured financial/macro data in real-time.  
2. *Generates creditworthiness scores* for issuers & asset classes.  
3. *Provides explainability* by showing feature contributions, trends, and event-driven reasoning.  
4. *Delivers insights via an interactive dashboard* for analysts and decision-makers.  
5. *Ensures deployment readiness* with containerization, scalability, and reproducibility.

## 🏗 Features Implemented
### 1. High-Throughput Data Ingestion & Processing
- Data Sources:
  - *Structured*: Yahoo Finance API, Alpha Vantage, World Bank/FRED datasets  
  - *Unstructured*: Financial news headlines & sentiment analysis  
- Features:
  - Data cleaning, normalization & transformation  
  - Fault-tolerant ingestion with retry mechanisms  
  - Scalable pipeline for multiple issuers  

### 2. Adaptive Scoring Engine
- Creditworthiness scoring using *interpretable ML models* (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression).  
- Incremental learning for frequent updates.  
- Black-box models (Random Forest/XGBoost) combined with *explainability layers (SHAP, LIME)*.  

### 3. Explainability Layer
- Feature contribution breakdowns  
- Short-term & long-term trend indicators  
- Event-based reasoning from unstructured sources  
- Plain-language summaries for non-technical stakeholders  

### 4. Interactive Analyst Dashboard
- Score trends visualization  
- Feature importance charts  
- Filtering & comparison with agency ratings  
- Alerts for sudden score changes  

### 5. End-to-End Deployment
- Containerized using *Docker*  
- Supports automated retraining and real-time updates  
- Public demo URL (to be added when deployed)
